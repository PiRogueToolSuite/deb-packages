pirogue-networking (1.3.3) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Move hostapd before dnsmasq: in the systemd+networkd case, in AP mode,
    dnsmasq might fail to manage the wireless interface, which `networkctl
    status` reports with `no-carrier` and `configuring`.

pirogue-networking (1.3.1) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Update comment regarding the 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16
    reject in the filter/forward chain. Stick to mentioning “external
    network” (singular) even if we're about to support blocking several
    external networks.
  * Replace the hardcoded 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16 with
    an @EXTERNAL_NETWORKS@ token, using nftables_list_of_networks as the
    associated variable type.
  * Bump pirogue-admin dependency accordingly.

pirogue-networking (1.2.2) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Improve dnsmasq.service override, using RestartSec=5 instead of the
    ExecStartPre= mess in the previous version.
  * Call `pirogue-admin --redeploy --commit` from postinst when upgrading.
  * Add pirogue-admin to Depends accordingly.

pirogue-networking (1.2.1) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Make sure dnsmasq.service doesn't exit immediately on startup when the
    VPN mode is used: if the interface is missing (which is the case for
    wg0 during early boot), the service exits immediately and doesn't even
    try to start a few times. Trying to adjust ordering or dependencies
    would be tricky as wg-quick@.service lists nss-lookup.target in After=
    and Wants= while dnsmasq.service lists it in Wants= and Before=.
    Therefore implement the following:
     - Insert a `sleep 5` delay before the existing ExecStartPre action
       (that checks the configuration), otherwise we would hit the burst
       limit anyway (5 attempts in 10 seconds).
     - Add `Restart=on-failure`, otherwise we only get one only chance.

pirogue-networking (1.2.0) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Rename source and binary package from pirogue-ap to a more generic
    pirogue-networking, as we're adding support for more use cases, while
    retaining the main building blocks at the network configuration level.
  * Delete postinst script, letting pirogue-admin deal with autodetection,
    and with configuring the various services based on the templates.
  * Turn all configuration files and related actions into templates
    shipped into a subdirectory of /usr/share/pirogue-admin/.
  * Drop Provides/Conflicts on pirogue-network-routing: it's much easier
    to have a single package managing the network than having several
    packages providing this feature through a virtual package.
  * Add nftables to Depends, as a first step towards supporting only one
    way to express firewall rules: supporting both nftables and iptables
    means duplicating rules, and focusing on one of them should be enough.
  * Add wireguard-tools to Depends, as a first step towards supporting the
    VPN use case.
  * Mask dnsmasq.service in preinst: Debian-provided cloud images include
    systemd-networkd and systemd-resolved, and the latter prevents dnsmasq
    from getting installed successfully with its default configuration.
    Therefore, mask the unit when the package gets installed initially,
    until pirogue-admin kicks in, and uses the template which restricts
    the interfaces the daemon listens on, avoiding the conflict.
  * Make sure dnsmasq doesn't get confused by resolvconf bits shipped by
    systemd-resolved, by forcing RESOLV_CONF=/etc/resolv.conf through
    a systemd unit override.
  * When the NFTABLES_MODE condition is met, make sure nftables.service is
    enabled and restarted.
  * Replace the initial @DHCP_RANGE@ implementation with a more generic
    @DHCP_RANGE_LINE@, making it possible to keep dnsmasq enabled for all
    modes, while also making it possible to disable DHCP support (e.g. to
    avoid a rogue DHCP server in APPLIANCE mode, depending on the network
    setup). Replace the DNSMASQ_NEEDED condition with an ENABLE_DHCP
    variable accordingly.

pirogue-ap (1.1.2) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Remove dhcpcd5 from Depends: it's a transitional package for dhcpcd
    in the first place, can trigger conflicts with raspberrypi-sys-mods
    in Raspberry OS (which some users attempted to use until we added
    experimental support for Raspberry Pi 5), and is likely responsible
    for some reported connection losses, possibly by racing against
    dhclient.
  * Stop shipping dhcpcd.conf accordingly.
  * Stop tweaking dhcpcd.conf during postinst accordingly.
  * Adjust /etc/network/interfaces.d/wlan0:
     - If upgrading, from a version strictly before 1.1.2, archive it
       under /root, then stop, disable, mask dhcpcd. Make sure wlan0 is
       still configured with 10.8.0.1/24 afterwards.
     - In any case, write the static configuration: IPv4 = 10.8.0.1/24.
