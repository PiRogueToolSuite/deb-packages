pirogue-base (1.2.0) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Switch from pirogue-ap to pirogue-networking. This package already
    supports the “access point” mode but will also support the “appliance”
    and “vpn” ones in the near future.
  * Add pirogue-admin to dependencies, it's the central component managing
    the configuration (including autodetecting settings, applying config
    changes, etc.).
  * Add postinst to bootstrap the configuration during the very first
    installation.

pirogue-base (1.1.0) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release, targeting Debian 12.
  * Adjust pirogue-screen-st7789-240x240 dependency, accepting
    pirogue-screen as a suitable alternative (#13). That means keeping the
    existing package as the preferred solution for this dependency, while
    making it possible to switch to a different package later on, that
    would also provide the pirogue-screen virtual package.
