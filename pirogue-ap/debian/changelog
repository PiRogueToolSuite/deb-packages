pirogue-ap (1.1.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Remove dhcpcd5 from Depends: it's a transitional package for dhcpcd
    in the first place, can trigger conflicts with raspberrypi-sys-mods
    in Raspberry OS (which some users attempted to use until we added
    experimental support for Raspberry Pi 5), and is likely responsible
    for some reported connection losses, possibly by racing against
    dhclient.
  * Stop shipping dhcpcd.conf accordingly.
