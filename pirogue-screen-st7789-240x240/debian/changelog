pirogue-screen-st7789-240x240 (1.1.0) bookworm; urgency=medium

  [ Cyril Brulebois ]
  * New upstream release, targeting Debian 12.
  * Stop bundling Adafruit Blinka and friends.
  * Delete dh overrides accordingly.
  * Switch Architecture back from any to all accordingly.
  * Add python3-libgpiod and python3-spidev to Depends for the upcoming
    rewrite using standard tools.
  * Add Conflicts and Replaces alongside Provides, and switch to a slightly
    shorter package name: pirogue-screen (#13).
  * When running on a supported Raspberry Pi, with Debian arm64, deploy
    our custom DTBO, enable it, add a udev rule to create /dev/spidev0.0
    from userland also refreshing the initramfs if needed, and run hooks
    to refresh config.txt and redeploy DTBs.
  * When running on a supported Raspberry Pi, with Raspberry OS, enable
    the vendor-shipped SPI DTBO.

  [ U+039b ]
  * Port code to the standard libgpiod and spidev modules (#10).

pirogue-screen-st7789-240x240 (1.0.2) bullseye; urgency=medium

  * To avoid installing a bunch of packages on the target via pip, a quick and
    dirty “bundle everything” approach was chosen. It's not perfect, but this
    package might be replaced with another one at some point, so it was decided
    not to try and package all those modules separately and properly.
  * Bundle the contents of /usr/local/lib/python3.9/dist-packages/ after a
    `pip install Adafruit-Blinka==6.17.0` call:
     - under armhf/, using a Pi 4 B running Raspbian bullseye armhf;
     - under arm64/, using a Pi 4 B running Debian bullseye arm64.
  * Switch the package to `Architecture: any` accordingly. It needs to be built
    once with `-aarm64` and once with `-aarmhf`. This should be possible on any
    systems (e.g. on amd64), without having to configure anything specific.
  * Use the DEB_HOST_ARCH variable in the .install file to ship the contents of
    the right directory under the usr/lib/pirogue/screen-st7789-240x240/
    directory depending on the architecture the package is being built for.
    Using this private directory ensures that those modules and extensions can't
    interfere with system packages.
  * Move src/ST7789.py alongside to have a single private directory.
  * Set PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/pirogue/screen-st7789-240x240 via the systemd unit
    so that the daemon can find everything it needs.
  * Ship the daemon under /usr/sbin, without its .py suffix, with an explicit
    name (matching the package), and with the usual python3 shebang.
  * Set some lintian overrides to silence errors and warnings that are valid but
    also normal given the design choice we're making.
  * Disable dh_strip and dh_shlibdeps for the same reason.
  * Enable the python3 dh add-on to get appropriate Python dependencies.
  * Fix missing dependencies on net-tools (for ifconfig) and python3-systemd.
  * Since we're shipping everything we need for Adafruit-Blinka, delete pip from
    preinst, and python3-pip from Depends.
