pirogue-hardware-detection (1.1.0) bookworm; urgency=medium

  * Initial Release.
  * Deploy flag files under /var/lib/pirogue/hardware/ based on hardware
    and software detection:
     - is_raspberrypi_hw when a supported Raspberry Pi model is spotted.
     - is_raspberrypi_os on ARM systems when raspi-firmware is not
       installed.
     - is_debian_os on ARM systems when raspi-firmware is installed, and
       on non-ARM systems.
  * Ship Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 DTBs built from src:linux as found in Debian
    12, with mainline commits 3cdba279c5e9 and e925743edc0d cherry-picked,
    so that they're built with -@, making it easier to apply DTBOs.
  * Deploy a z51-pirogue-hardware-detection hook to make sure custom DTBs
    override mainline DTBs as deployed via the z50-raspi-firmware hook
    (only acting on Debian mainline systems running on Raspberry Pi 3 or
    4, on arm64).
